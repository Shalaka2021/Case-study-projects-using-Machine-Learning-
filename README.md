-Iris Classification using DecisionTreeClassifier

-Iris Classification using KNN

-Play Predictor:There is one data set of weather conditions.
That dataset contains information as weather and we have to decides whether to play or
not.
Data set contains the target variable as Play which indicates whether to play or not.
Consider below Play Predictor Dataset given.

-Wine Predictor:There is one data set of wine which classify the wines according to its contents into three
classes.These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy
but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13
constituents found in each of the three types of wines.Wine data set contains 13 features as
1) Alcohol
2) Malic acid
3) Ash
4) Alcalinity of ash
5) Magnesium
6) Total phenols
7) Flavanoids
8) Nonflavanoid phenols
9) Proanthocyanins
10)Color intensity
11)Hue
12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13)Proline
According to the above features wine can be classified as
• Class 1
• Class 2
• Class 3

-User defined KNN:In this I have tried to implement User defined KNN.
